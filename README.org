* Purpose
This is a not-very-serious program meant to show a really quick way to 
hack up a goroutine heavy program that doesn't do too much.  

It builds up a map of words, to be used as a set, from a dictionary.
Then, using the argument provided on the command line, it validates it as a
word against this dictionary.  For every word provided it finds all the
potential subwords that can be produced by dropping a letter.  Each of those
potential subwords is sieved through the dictionary map.

So many things about this program could potentially be done better.  Please
don't judge me :-).
